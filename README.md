 Stock-Price-Picker
The Stock Price Tracker is a comprehensive Python-based tool for analyzing stock market trends and gaining insights into stock performance. It leverages the Alpha Vantage API to fetch real-time and historical stock data, processes the data with Pandas, and visualizes key technical indicators using Matplotlib.

Features:
Fetch Stock Data:

Retrieve daily stock price data, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume, for any publicly traded stock using its ticker symbol.
Technical Indicators:

Moving Averages (MA):
                      10-day and 20-day simple moving averages to track short-term trends.
                      Relative Strength Index (RSI):
                      A momentum indicator to identify overbought (RSI > 70) and oversold (RSI < 30) conditions.
Bollinger Bands:
                Volatility bands around a 20-day simple moving average to highlight price fluctuations.
                Visualization:

Plot stock closing prices along with moving averages and Bollinger Bands.
Display RSI in a separate chart with clear thresholds for overbought and oversold levels.
Interactive, clear, and professional visualizations suitable for presentations.
Error Handling:

Includes robust error handling for invalid API keys, incorrect stock symbols, and unexpected data issues.
User Input:

Prompts users to enter their API key and stock symbol for dynamic analysis of any stock.

Workflow:
          The user provides their Alpha Vantage API key and desired stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.).
          The program fetches and processes the stock data.
          Key indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands) are calculated.
          The tool generates detailed visualizations to interpret the stock's performance.
Use Cases:
          Identify short-term and long-term trends in stock prices.
          Evaluate stock volatility and market momentum.
          Assist investors in making data-driven decisions.
          Provide insights for educational and research purposes in financial analysis.
